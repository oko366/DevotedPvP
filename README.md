* Sanitized Kits

and more...

## Sanitized Kits

Turn off all sanitization, useful if you've got a lot of custom stuff or only allow kitbuilding via chest / command block, just set
`cleanInventories: false` in config.yml. We strongly recommend leaving it on if you allow gamemode 1 kitbuilding as it will restrict to
valid, vanilla kitouts only and prevent exploitative blocks, items, and enchants.

If you have specific items that should be exempted, consider creating a mod that listens for com.biggestnerd.devotedpvp.ItemSafeEvent . Call "setValid()" on the event if the ItemStack it holds should be permitted.

Kits are sanitized on save, load, and when entering a duel.

One small important thing, the World Spawn location is the lobby location, to change lobby locations change the world spawn location.
